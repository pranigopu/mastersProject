# Practical resources
- [BlackJAX](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) (a library of samplers for [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax))

# Reading material
## For learning Bayesian inference basics
- Murphy, Kevin P. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, 2012
    - Check chapters 3 and 7
- [Paulo Rauber's Notes](https://www.paulorauber.com/files/notes/machine_learning.pdf)
    - Summarises first 17 chapters of Murphy's textbook (listed above)
    - Check chapters 3 and 7 (corresponds to chapters 3 and 7 of Murphy's book)
    - Is less readable but more mathematically rigorous than Murphy's book
- [Bayesian Computation Online Textbook](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html)

## For learning Bayesian neural network basics

# Bayesian vs. frequentist

> **Reference**: [Bayesian vs frequentist statistics, Ox educ](https://youtu.be/r76oDIvwETI?si=Fk8-Z6kLIhqULcTq)

**Bayesian**:

Focuses on the uncertainty of underlying conditions that generate certain outcomes. Hence, the potential underlying models are distributed probabilistically. In other words, the Bayesian approach measures the quality of the evidence (i.e. the observed data) for a hypothesis (i.e. a hypothesised model).

**Frequentist**:

Focuses on the uncertainty of the outcomes given certain underlying conditions. Hence, the potential outcomes are distributed probabilistically. In other words, the frequentist approach measures the expected proportional frequency of potential outcomes based on past outcomes.

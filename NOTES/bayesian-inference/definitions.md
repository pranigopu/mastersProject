**DEFINITIONS**

---

**Population**:

A population is a set of similar entities. It can be finite or infinite (i.e. referring to every known entity of a certain nature as well as any potential entity of the same nature that we may encounter in the future). Hence, the concept of a population generalises the concepts of "set" and "concept".

**System**:

A system is any integration of interacting entities, e.g. a complex entity, a model, a process, etc. A system, hence, is a generic term for anything that exists and acts in a certain way so as to produce certain measurements and/or outcomes.

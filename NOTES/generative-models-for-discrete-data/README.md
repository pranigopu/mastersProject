# Generative model for discrete data
A generative model means a model that generates data based on a well-defined random process. For example, a Gaussian generative model generates data based on a normal distribution. In practice, a generative model is proposed to explain the observed data by showing how and with what likelihood the model could generate to the observed data. I  practice, we try to find the most plausible generative model that explains the observed data. As the topic suggests, we shall explore generative models that draw data from discrete sample spaces rather than continuous sample spaces.

## Bayesian concept learning
In Bayesian concept learning, the generative models are represented using a "concept", i.e. a set of all units that fit a definition. Note that the concept represents the sample space from which data can be drawn. Hence, we try to find the most plausible concept, i.e. the most plausible sample space from which the observed data could have been drawn. In other words, we try to learn the most plausible concept which the observed data may fall under.

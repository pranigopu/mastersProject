**MARKOV CHAINS**

---

A Markov process summarises the influence of the past on the future using the notion of a state, wherein the state evolves over time according to some probability distribution.

```

Past -----> Future
    \     /
     State

```

In other terms, $state(t+1) = f(state(t), noise)$, where $f$ is a function.

The point estimate approach, which is the traditional ap￾proach in deep learning, is relatively easy to deploy with modern algorithms and software packages, but tends to lack
explainability \[14\]. The final model might also generalize in unforeseen and overconfident ways on out-of-training￾distribution data points \[15, 16\]. This property, in addition to the inability of ANNs to say “I don’t know”, is problematic for many critical applications. Of all the techniques that exist to mitigate this \[17\], stochastic neural networks have proven to be one of the most generic and flexible.
